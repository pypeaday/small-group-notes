# DEPRECATED

All my notes have been migrated to my blog, [pype.dev](https://pype.dev/faith) and are stored in that repo: https://github.com/pypeaday/pype.dev/

## Notes 

1. Tiddlers are manually exported as static html
2. `rename.py` will check all files in `posts` and rename appropriately assuming the exports are named `N_ Title subtitle.html`
3. `ansible-vault decrypt .env`
4. `docker-compose build`
5. `ansible-vault encrypt .env`
6. `docker-compose up -d`

## TODO

1. Move site to server
2. Try to make it look nicer... the `app` directory and `server.py` aren't doing anything right now
