## Priests

God creates Eden in which he places humans to be his royal image - priests. God
sets humans up to receive his blessing but humans choose their own way. The
promise is for a priest and a sacrifice to come in Jesus.

God chooses Abraham and Sarah as the first royal priesthood as they are chosen
by God to bless all the nations.

## Melchizedek

A priestly king of Salem. Melchizedek recognizes Yahweh as the God of gods -
Abraham tithes to him and that's about the end of the story

Salem is ancient short name for Jerusalem. 
Abraham's tithe to Melchizedek is just like the Israelite call to tithe to the
Levites (priests) to support them.

## Royal Family

Abraham and Sarah are promised their own children but they take amtters into
their own hands by scheming with Hagar. Eventually Sarah is given her own son,
Issac, who God then calls for his life as a test of Abraham - it represents God
challenging Abraham to trust him with his own promise, and to not go his own
way with Sarah

DUring the Isaac sacrifice narrative a ram is given in place and Abraham names the place "God will provide".

## Types

The story of God's call to sacrifice Isaac is much like the story of Abraham
meeting Melchizedek. In the Melchizedek story Abraham meets a priest on a high
place and gives him an offering. In the Isaac story Abraham acts as the priest
and a ram is given to him by the LORD that covers the sins of Abraham's family.

!!! note "Atonement and Covering"

    Covering the sin in this case looks much more like redemption and resolve
    rather than payment for gult, similar to a small-scale apology can cover a
    grievance even though no payment is made to make anything 'right', the
    'covering' is simply a sign of forgiveness
