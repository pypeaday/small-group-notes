# Peace 

!!! note

    generally means absnese of war

In Hebrew the word is `Shalom` (Greek: Eirene). Basic biblical meeting of
Shalom is "complete" or "whole". ie. a stone with no cracks, or stone wall with
nogaps or missing grips

References a complex situation with nothing missing

Shalom can refer to a person's well-being... Life is complex and when anything
is out of alignment our Shalom breaks down and needs to be restored

To bring shalom is to make complete or restore

In Proverbs, to reconcile a broken relationship is to make shalom

## Isaiah


!!! scripture
    
    Isaiah 9:6-7

    6 For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us;
    And the government will rest on His shoulders;
    And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
    Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.
    7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace,
    On the throne of David and over his kingdom,
    To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness
    From then on and forevermore.
    The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this. 

## Jesus

Jesus restores the broken relationship between humans and our creator.

!!! scripture

    Ephesians 2:14-15

    Jesus himeself is our _Eirene_

# Questions

!!! note

    The prophet Isaiah looked forward to the arrival of a future king who would
    make a covenant of shalom (peace, well-being) with his people. This king
    would set the world right and heal all that has been harmed. Read Isaiah
    9:6-7 aloud together. What specific words or phrases stand out to you as
    you observe this passage and why?

!!! scripture

    Isaiah 9:6-7 6
    For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to
    us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be
    called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.
    7There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the
    throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with
    justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the
    Lord of hosts will accomplish this.


Words: child, given to us, government will rest, no end to the increase, zeal...will accomplish this

!!! note

    The prophet Isaiah looked forward to the arrival of the Prince of Peace, whose
    reign would lead to eternal shalom. Jesus’ arrival fulfilled Isaiah’s words.
    Read and reflect on Luke 2:9-15 as a group. Why do you think God announced the
    King’s arrival to no-name shepherds? What does this tell you about the nature
    of God and his Kingdom?

!!! scripture

    Luke 2:9-15

    9And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the
    Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel
    said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great
    joy which will be for all the people; 11for today in the city of David
    there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12This will
    be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a
    manger.” 13And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the
    heavenly host praising God and saying,

    14“Glory to God in the highest,

    And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.”

    15When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began
    saying to one another, “Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this
    thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.”


!!! note

    The biblical story shows how humanity often chooses a way of life apart
    from God and suffers as a result. According to Colossians 1:19-23 , what
    did God want to do to remedy this pain, and how did he accomplish his
    desire through Jesus?

!!! scripture

    Colossians 1:19-23

    19For it was the Father’s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in
    Him, 20and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made
    peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on
    earth or things in heaven.

    21And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in
    evil deeds, 22yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through
    death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond
    reproach— 23if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and
    steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have
    heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I,
    Paul, was made a minister.
