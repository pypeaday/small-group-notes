# Matthew 24

## TL;DR

Marty makes the case the the entire discourse is about the destruction of Jerusalem, not about eschatology.
"To turn this into a dialogue about the end times would completely ignore Jesus' closing points about not knowing the future"

## Passage

Matthew 24:3–25:1 (ESV):

>3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples
>came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be, and what
>will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” 4 And Jesus
>answered them, “See that no one leads you astray. 5 For many will come in my
>name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. 6 And you will
>hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must
>take place, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and
>kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various
>places. 8 All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.
>
>9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you
>will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake. 10 And then many will fall
>away and betray one another and hate one another. 11 And many false prophets
>will arise and lead many astray. 12 And because lawlessness will be increased,
>the love of many will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to the end will be
>saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the
>whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. 15 “So
>when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel,
>standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), 16 then let those who
>are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 Let the one who is on the housetop not
>go down to take what is in his house, 18 and let the one who is in the field
>not turn back to take his cloak. 19 And alas for women who are pregnant and for
>those who are
>nursing infants in those days! 20 Pray that your flight may not be in winter or
>on a Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been
>from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. 22 And if
>those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the
>sake of the elect those days will be cut short. 23 Then if anyone says to you,
>‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. 24 For false
>christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so
>as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you
>beforehand. 26 So, if they say to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not
>go out. If they say, ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.
>27 For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so
>will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28 Wherever the corpse is, there the
>vultures will gather.
>
>29 “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the
>sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will
>fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 Then will
>appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the
>earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of
>heaven with power and great glory. 31 And he will send out his angels with a
>loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one
>end of heaven to the other.
>
>32 “From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon
>as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is
>near. 33 So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at
>the very gates. 34 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away
>until all these things take place. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my
>words will not pass away.
>
>36 “But concerning that day and hour no one knows,
>not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. 37 For as were
>the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For as in those
>days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
>marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, 39 and they were unaware
>until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son
>of Man. 40 Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left.
>41 Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left.
>42 Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.
>43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the
>night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let
>his house be broken into. 44 Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of
>Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
>
>45 “Who then is the faithful and
>wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their
>food at the proper time? 46 Blessed is that servant whom his master will find
>so doing when he comes. 47 Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his
>possessions. 48 But if that wicked servant says to himself, ‘My master is
>delayed,’ 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with
>drunkards, 50 the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not
>expect him and at an hour he does not know 51 and will cut him in pieces and
>put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing
>of teeth.

## Notes through passage reading

Jesus' disciples _do want to know about end times but Jesus is having a different conversation (as usual)_

### 4:15

Jesus didn't say the paranthetical comment "(let the reader understand)" even though it's red in several translations

### 4:4-4:21

Jesus' point is to _not get caught up in eschatological ideas_... __TL;DR the world is getting crazy__

### 4:23-25

People will claim to have the answers but Jesus is clear that no one can know

### 4:34

__This generation will not pass away__

Jesus is talking about impending and current doom for Jerusalem

### odd stuff

1. Sign of the Son of Man in heaven
2. Angel coming with sound of trumpet
3. gather the elect from the 4 winds

Jesus uses language from the Prophets to refer to coming destruction.
Jesus isn't making anything up - the messages to Israel in the Prophets was
about perseverance and that is the message Jesus gives to the Christians before
the desstruction of Jerusalem


### 4:38-41

Jesus references the flood - but who was taken? The evil and wicked people were taken away.
Jesus' parable of the fish in the net - the bad fish are thrown away.
Parable of the weeds and wheat - the weeds get thrown away.

__When something is taken and something remains it is the good thing that remains... Left Behind gets it wrong__

So when Jesus says there's two men in the field, or two women grinding at the
mill... who will be taken? The bad one.. who will be left? **the good one**
