# Matthew 24

## TL;DR

Marty makes the case the the entire discourse is about the destruction of Jerusalem, not about eschatology.
"To turn this into a dialogue about the end times would completely ignore Jesus' closing points about not knowing the future"

## Passage
Matthew 24:4–35 (ESV): 4 And Jesus answered them, “See that no one leads you
astray. 5 For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they
will lead many astray. 6 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that
you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. 7 For
nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be
famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are but the beginning of
the birth pains.

9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you
to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake. 10 And then
many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. 11 And many
false prophets will arise and lead many astray. 12 And because lawlessness will
be increased, the love of many will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to
the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed
throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will
come. 

15 “So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the
prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), 16 then
let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 Let the one who is on the
housetop not go down to take what is in his house, 18 and let the one who is in
the field not turn back to take his cloak. 19 And alas for women who are
pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! 20 Pray that your
flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great
tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now,
no, and never will be. 22 And if those days had not been cut short, no human
being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut
short. 23 Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he
is!’ do not believe it. 24 For false christs and false prophets will arise and
perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the
elect. 25 See, I have told you beforehand. 26 So, if they say to you, ‘Look, he
is in the wilderness,’ do not go out. If they say, ‘Look, he is in the inner
rooms,’ do not believe it. 27 For as the lightning comes from the east and
shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28 Wherever
the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.

29 “Immediately after the
tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give
its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens
will be shaken. 30 Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and
then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man
coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And he will send
out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from
the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.

32 “From the fig tree
learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves,
you know that summer is near. 33 So also, when you see all these things, you
know that he is near, at the very gates. 34 Truly, I say to you, this
generation will not pass away until all these things take place. 35 Heaven and
earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

## Notes through passage reading

Jesus' disciples _do want to know about end times but Jesus is having a different conversation (as usual)_

### 4:15

Jesus didn't say the paranthetical comment "(let the reader understand)" even though it's red in several translations

### 4:4-4:21

Jesus' point is to _not get caught up in eschatological ideas_... __TL;DR the world is getting crazy__
