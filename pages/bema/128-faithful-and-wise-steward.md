# Matthew 24

## TL;DR

Marty makes the case the entire discourse is about the destruction of Jerusalem, not about eschatology.
"To turn this into a dialogue about the end times would completely ignore Jesus' closing points about not knowing the future"

## Passage

Matthew 24:3–25:1 (ESV):

>3 As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples
>came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be, and what
>will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” 4 And Jesus
>answered them, “See that no one leads you astray. 5 For many will come in my
>name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. 6 And you will
>hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must
>take place, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and
>kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various
>places. 8 All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.
>
>9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you
>will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake. 10 And then many will fall
>away and betray one another and hate one another. 11 And many false prophets
>will arise and lead many astray. 12 And because lawlessness will be increased,
>the love of many will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to the end will be
>saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the
>whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. 15 “So
>when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel,
>standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), 16 then let those who
>are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 Let the one who is on the housetop not
>go down to take what is in his house, 18 and let the one who is in the field
>not turn back to take his cloak. 19 And alas for women who are pregnant and for
>those who are
>nursing infants in those days! 20 Pray that your flight may not be in winter or
>on a Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been
>from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. 22 And if
>those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the
>sake of the elect those days will be cut short. 23 Then if anyone says to you,
>‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. 24 For false
>christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so
>as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you
>beforehand. 26 So, if they say to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not
>go out. If they say, ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.
>27 For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so
>will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28 Wherever the corpse is, there the
>vultures will gather.
>
>29 “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the
>sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will
>fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 Then will
>appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the
>earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of
>heaven with power and great glory. 31 And he will send out his angels with a
>loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one
>end of heaven to the other.
>
>32 “From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon
>as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is
>near. 33 So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at
>the very gates. 34 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away
>until all these things take place. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my
>words will not pass away.
>
>36 “But concerning that day and hour no one knows,
>not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. 37 For as were
>the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For as in those
>days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
>marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, 39 and they were unaware
>until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son
>of Man. 40 Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left.
>41 Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left.
>42 Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.
>43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the
>night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let
>his house be broken into. 44 Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of
>Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
>
>45 “Who then is the faithful and
>wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their
>food at the proper time? 46 Blessed is that servant whom his master will find
>so doing when he comes. 47 Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his
>possessions. 48 But if that wicked servant says to himself, ‘My master is
>delayed,’ 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with
>drunkards, 50 the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not
>expect him and at an hour he does not know 51 and will cut him in pieces and
>put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing
>of teeth.

## Notes through passage reading

Jesus' disciples _do want to know about end times but Jesus is having a different conversation (as usual)_

### 4:15

Jesus didn't say the parenthetical comment "(let the reader understand)" even though it's red in several translations

### 4:4-4:21

Jesus' point is to _not get caught up in eschatological ideas_... __TL;DR the world is getting crazy__

### 4:23-25

People will claim to have the answers but Jesus is clear that no one can know

### 4:34

__This generation will not pass away__

Jesus is talking about impending and current doom for Jerusalem

### odd stuff

1. Sign of the Son of Man in heaven
2. Angel coming with sound of trumpet
3. gather the elect from the 4 winds

Jesus uses language from the Prophets to refer to coming destruction.
Jesus isn't making anything up - the messages to Israel in the Prophets was
about perseverance and that is the message Jesus gives to the Christians before
the desstruction of Jerusalem


### 4:38-41

Jesus references the flood - but who was taken? The evil and wicked people were taken away.
Jesus' parable of the fish in the net - the bad fish are thrown away.
Parable of the weeds and wheat - the weeds get thrown away.

__When something is taken and something remains it is the good thing that remains... Left Behind gets it wrong__

So when Jesus says there's two men in the field, or two women grinding at the
mill... who will be taken? The bad one.. who will be left? **the good one**

__Dispensationalism is a theology best left behind__

_But this passage isn't about eschatology anyways - it's about their current Jerusalem_

### 4:45-51

Who is the faithful and wise steward? It's the priesthood, and they are not getting the job done.

__I don't quite follow Marty's points on this part of the passage - he jumps right into a summary__

## Summary

**This has been Jesus' response to the disciples when they asked about the end times**

1. There will be rumors of false messiahs - do not believe them
2. The world is going to get crazy and there's nothing you can do to stop it 
3. All of these things are going to happen and you have to persevere
4. You have to be ready - which means taking care of God's people
5. The priests aren't doing it so you have to
6. Persevere and be ready by taking care of the oppressed (God's people or not)

Jesus re-enforces this teaching by telling us 3 parables in rapid succession.
Did Jesus actually say them back to back to back? We'll never know but we do
know it's how Matthew recorded it which is just as significant.

# The Parables

> Matthew 25:1–46 (ESV):
>
> 25 “Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten
> virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. 2 Five of them
> were foolish, and five were wise. 3 For when the foolish took their lamps,
> they took no oil with them, 4 but the wise took flasks of oil with their
> lamps. 5 As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept.
> 6 But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet
> him.’ 7 Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. 8 And the
> foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going
> out.’ 9 But the wise answered, saying, ‘Since there will not be enough for us
> and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.’ 10 And while
> they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in
> with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. 11 Afterward the other
> virgins came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open to us.’ 12 But he answered,
> ‘Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.’ 13 Watch therefore, for you know
> neither the day nor the hour.
>
> 14 “For it will be like a man going on a
> journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. 15 To
> one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according
> to his ability. Then he went away. 16 He who had received the five talents
> went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. 17 So also
> he who had the two talents made two talents more. 18 But he who had received
> the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money. 19 Now
> after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with
> them. 20 And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five
> talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have
> made five talents more.’ 21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and
> faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over
> much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 22 And he also who had the two
> talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here,
> I have made two talents more.’ 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good
> and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you
> over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 24 He also who had received
> the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man,
> reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed,
> 25 so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you
> have what is yours.’ 26 But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful
> servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I
> scattered no seed? 27 Then you ought to have invested my money with the
> bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with
> interest. 28 So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten
> talents. 29 For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an
> abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
> 30 And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place
> there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
>
> 31 “When the Son of Man comes
> in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious
> throne. 32 Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate
> people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
> 33 And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.
> 34 Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed
> by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
> world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave
> me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 36 I was naked and you
> clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to
> me.’ 37 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see
> you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? 38 And when did we
> see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? 39 And when did
> we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ 40 And the King will answer
> them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my
> brothers, you did it to me.’
>
> 41 “Then he will say to those on his left,
> ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and
> his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and
> you gave me no drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked
> and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’
> 44 Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or
> thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to
> you?’ 45 Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did
> not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ 46 And
> these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal
> life.”

## Foolish Bridesmaids

Context of Jewish weddings helps us understand this parable. We know that the
groom goes away to literally build onto his father's house a space for him and
his new family. The groom can literally come back at any time but the entire
village knows this. So the bridesmaids who run out of oil are showing extreme
folly by not being prepared for a celebration that everyone in the village is
anticipating.

## Talents

Jesus wants to convey that people will give an account for how they used what
God gave them for God's kingdom. The amount of the talents may be pointing to
something as well...

Number of talents | Meaning | summary |
--- | --- | --- |
5 | Books of Moses | Some people have an in-depth working knowledge of all that God has asked |
2 | 10 commandments (2 tablets) | Some people are given only a basic understanding of who God is
1 | just God | Some people are ignorant of the law but still have an awareness of who God is

__God expects you to use what he's given you to bless the world and if you do not use it God will judge that laziness.__

## Sheep and Goats

Q: What is it that condemns the goats as goats?
A: The sheep are praised because they hear the cry and take care of the
marginalized, but the goats do not participate in God's justice for the world

# Summary

The parables in Matthew 25 re-enforce the same set of points Jesus made in Matthew 24

1. You're going to hear rumors of the end and false messiahs; do not believe it 
2. The world is going to get crazy and there is nothing you can do to stop it. 
3. All of this is going to have to happen and you will have to persevere. (Talents)
4. You will have to be ready; being ready means taking care of God's people. (Bridesmaids)
5. The priests aren't doing it, so you will have to (Sheep and Goats)
6. Persevere and be ready by taking care of the oppressed. (Talents)

## Ra-mez (Hebrew word Marty probably defines in session 2)

> Jeremiah 25:8–11 (ESV)
>
> 8 “Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Because you
> have not obeyed my words, 9 behold, I will send for all the tribes of the
> north, declares the Lord, and for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my
> servant, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and
> against all these surrounding nations. I will devote them to destruction, and
> make them a horror, a hissing, and an everlasting desolation. 10 Moreover, I
> will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice
> of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the grinding of the millstones
> and the light of the lamp. 11 This whole land shall become a ruin and a
> waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. 
>
>The Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Je 25:8–11). (2016). Crossway Bibles.

The key to looking at these references is in the larger context of each ra-mez.

Does it make sense in Matt 24/25 that Jesus ra-mez the use of Nebuchadnezzar as
a tool of God to destroy the people to remove the sound of joy and weddings
from their midst... Does it make sense that Jesus' drash would be the use of
Rome to destroy the city of Jerusalem (wasn't that the whole point of Matthew
24)


## Parable of the Talents

Matthew's parable of the talents is really confusing on its own because the
context of Jesus' original parable is in the context of Herod of Antipas. Luke
tells us a lot about the tension between Jesus and Herod of Antipas. So we need
to understand the Talents in light of the parable Luke 19 records as the parable
of the Minas. This might be the original/same parable, or is at least a
relevant one.

Jesus employs a rabbincal tool called "cal-va ho-mer" which means "greater and
lesser". The rabbi uses a negative example to portray a universal trait. Then
after making the case that the trait is true the rabbi will imply how much more
than is the same truth applied in a positive example.

When Herod the Great died - his kingdom was willed to his 3 sons and they each
set said to Rome individually. They each asked Caesar to honor their father's
will. The Jews (Phariasees) also set a delegation on the 4th ship to plead with
Caesar to _not_ name Antipas king. He was named a Tetrarch instead which made
Herod Antipas furious. He blamed the Pharisees and made an example of them by
slaughtering them. This is the cultural setting that serves as the backdrop to
the 10 Minas parable. The parable of the 10 talents is that someone will have
to give an account for what we've been entrusted with. This principle helps us
understand why the king is so evil in the parable - it's not God it's Herod
Antipas.

### The ra-mez

> 2 Kings 22:3–7 (ESV)
> 3 In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent
> Shaphan the son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the secretary, to the house of
> the Lord, saying, 4 “Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the
> money that has been brought into the house of the Lord, which the keepers of
> the threshold have collected from the people. 5 And let it be given into the
> hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the Lord, and let
> them give it to the workmen who are at the house of the Lord, repairing the
> house 6 (that is, to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons),
> and let them use it for buying timber and quarried stone to repair the house.
> 7 But no accounting shall be asked from them for the money that is delivered
> into their hand, for they deal honestly.”
>
> The Holy Bible: English Standard Version (2 Ki 22:3–7). (2016). Crossway Bibles.

We look back in OT and find God's people working on the temple. They are honest
and so they don't even have to give an account. It's not the priests, but it's
the people who are working on restoration who do not need to be trusted.
Juxtaposed with the priests of Jesus' day who are not taking care God's people
and so in their dishonesty will have to give an account. 

Jesus' drash is that those who are not priests should do the work of the
priests in restoring the world and if they are honest, in light of the priests'
dishonesty, they are doing the work of the Lord and have no concern with giving
an account.
