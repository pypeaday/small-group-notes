# Hellenism

> pleasing the gods

`Alexander the Great` had his own _gospel_ (εὐαγγέλιον - euangelion: predates biblical authors. "Good news to share" as an idea is not uniquely biblical)

He conqoured the world, not with a huge army but with 4 things:

1. Education
2. Healthcare
3. Entertainment
4. Athletics

These 4 things pull on basically all people's values, Andrew the Great used them to control people...

1. Education - control what people know
2. Healthcare - make people dependent on the state's provision
3. Entertainment - control what people do with their time (theater was invented in this time)
4. Athletics - similar to entertainment - this becomes a pillar of culture

## Hasadim

Maccabeans who leave the Hasmonean group, go north, and build a fundamentalist Jewish culture in Galilee which is where Jesus grew up and did his ministry

They split into 2 groups - Zealots who use the sword, Pharisees who obedience to the text

## Rome

Jews (Saducees) persue Herod the Great in order to work things in light of Roman conquest, to remain good for the Jews

Herod split his kingdom to his sons after his death

1. Herod Archelaus (rules for a short time and is replaced by Pontius Pilot)
