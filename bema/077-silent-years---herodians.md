Herodians show up twice in the Gospels, Josephus talks about them a bit as
well. There is a lot of hsitorical debate that surrounds the Herodians.

They were believed to be the political party, however formal, to be alligned with Kind Herod. 

We are also, presently, very hellenistic and even herodian. We are into the
luxury, we like convenience, we have entertainment/theaters. There's nothing
wrong with luxury, entertainment, plumbing, wealth, etc... The Saducees misused
Hellenism to their own detrement - they turned amoral Hellenism into a
worldview that pushed Yahweh out of the center and put human and self into the
center of the worldview

> Herodians toed the line between _reluctantly_ becoming hellenistic and
> corrupting their worship with hellenism

!!! warning
    I am (hopefully _reluctantly_) hellenistic as well...

Embracing hellenism is not black and white, it is amoral... To spend money on
life, enjoy entertainment, decorate our homes, etc... can we appreciate
luxuries without compromising on Yahweh worship?
