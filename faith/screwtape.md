# Chapters

Below are just quick notes or quotes from each chapter as a reminder of what to
go back to chat about. This isn't intended to be in-depth by any stretch.

## Chapter 1

"Your man has been accustomed, ever since he was a boy, to have a dozen
incompatible philosophies dancing about together inside his head. He doesn't
think of doctrines as primarily 'true' or 'false', but as 'academic' or
'practical', 'outworn' or 'contemporary', 'conventional' or 'ruthless'"

## Chapter 2

## Chapter 3

pg 11. Keeping the patient's mind focused on the 'inner life' so his actions do not ever reflect his conversion 

pg 12. Creating an imaginary person for whom to pray... "In time, you may get the cleavage so wide that no thought or feeling from his prayers for the imagined mother will ever flow over into his treatment of the real one"

pg 13-14. "Let him assume that she knows how annoying it is and does it to annoy - if you know your job he will not notice the immense improbability of the assumption" -> This point is particularly convicting to me

> The last point about encouraging the patient to interpret the mother's every move in an over-sensitive fashion is actually very relatable for me

## Chapter 4

pg 15. Convincing the patient that scheduled prayer is wrong and that he must create a _mood_ within himself for real prayer reminds me of high school youth groups talking about "praying in the spirit" and  silly conversation "combating salvation by works" ideas like scheduled prayer times.

pg 16. "they constantly forget, what you must always remember, that they are animals and that whatever their bodies do affects their souls" ðŸ‘ˆ feels a lot like Genesis 3, and humans are never more human than when we exercise self-control.

pg. 16. "Keep them watching their own minds and trying to produce _feelings_ there by the action of their own wills"

> I totally remember feeling like I needed to want to pray in order for my prayers to matter

pg 17. "When they say they re praying for forgiveness, let them be trying to feel forgiven"

pg 18. "But whatever the nature of the composite object, you must keep him praying to _it_ - to the thing that he has made, not to the Person who has made him"

> Lewis talking actual idolatry with meaningful consequences... not the "money is my idol" take most pastors preach

## Chapter 5

pg 23. "...while tens of thousands who do not go so far as that will nevertheless have their attention diverted from themselves to values and causes which they believe to be higher than the self. I know that the Enemy disapproves many of these causes. But that is where He is so unfair. He often makes prizes of humans who have given their lives for causes He think bad on the monstrously sophistical ground that the humans thought them good and were following the best they knew"

> This reminds me of the young Tarkan in Narnia: The Last Battle, who Aslan ascribes all his good deeds done to Tash as done to himself - effectively saying the Tarkan's loyalty to the wrong god is honored by Aslan? Definitely want to know more about Lewis' thoughts there and here in Screwtape
